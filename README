"linksysmon"

Please see the file "COPYING" for copyright information.

linksysmon is a tool for monitoring Linksys BEFSR firewalls under
Linux and other Unix-like operating systems (I specify Linux because
that is what I used to develop it, and the only one I know for sure
works).  It accepts log mesages from the Linksys, and logs the
messages to /var/log/linksys.log.  It handles the standard activity
logs, as well as the "secret" extended logging, and can handle logs
from multiple firewalls.  When using extended logging, it can detect
external IP address changes (if you are using either DHCP or PPPOE)
and can call an external program to process the change.

The following files are installed by linksysmon:

/etc/init.d/linksysmon

The init script that starts and stops linksysmon

/etc/logrotate.d/linksysmon 

The configuration script for logrotate to automatically rotate
/var/log/linksys.log.

/etc/cron.daily/linksysmon-report

Daily cron job that calls /usr/sbin/linksysmon-report. 

/usr/sbin/linksysmon

The perl script that actually does the logging

/usr/sbin/linksysmon-ipchange

The default perl script that is called when linksysmon detects an IP
address change. This just sends mail to a list of addresses

/usr/sbin/linksysmon-ez-ipupdate

An alternate IP address change perl script that uses ez-ipupdate to
update an DNS entry in one of the following dynamic DNS services:

        * http://www.ez-ip.net
        * http://www.justlinux.com
        * http://www.dhs.org
        * http://www.dyndns.org
        * http://www.ods.org
        * http://gnudip.cheapnet.net (GNUDip)
        * http://www.dyn.ca (GNUDip)
        * http://www.tzo.com

This script is pretty much untested, so let me know if you encounter
any problems.  Send mail to mjw@purplefrog.com to let me know how it
works for you.

/usr/sbin/linksysmon-report

Generates an email report for the previous day's activity. Can filter
out hosts, ports, and types of log entries so that you only see the
stuff that might interest you.

/usr/sbin/linksysmon-watch

Default script called by linksysmon when a watched host or port has
some activity.  This script just sends email to a list of addresses.

linksysmon.pm

This perl module contains code common to all the linksysmon scripts.

linksys has been developed & tested under RedHat Linux 7.1.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
